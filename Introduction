This course is an introduction to computer science for students without prior programming experience. It explores problem-solving and data analysis using Python, a programming language with a simple syntax and a powerful set of libraries. This course covers basic data types and collections (lists, dictionaries, tuples, and sets), control flow, recursion, information hiding, and encapsulation using classes and objects, and introduces the analysis of program performance. The course teaches several mathematical, statistical, and computational methods that enable students to think critically about data as it is employed in various fields of inquiry. Other topics include visualization, an introduction to supervised machine learning, and the social and ethical dilemmas presented by such issues as software unreliability, algorithmic bias, and invasions of privacy.
